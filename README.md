# XCUtils

This is a little helper to resize @2x~ipad artwork to all required sizes using rmagick.
On top, the output will be formatted to suit XCodes requirements for sprite atlases.
Images will be resized carefully by first extending images to be dividable by 4 and then generating smaller half and quarter resolutions.
